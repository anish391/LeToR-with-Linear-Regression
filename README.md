# LeToR-with-Linear-Regression

The goal of this project is to use machine learning to solve a problem that arises in Information Retrieval,one known as the Learning to Rank (LeToR) problem. We formulate this as a problem of linear regression where we map an input vector x to a real-valued scalar target y(x;w).

There are two tasks:
1. Train a linear regression model on LeToR dataset using a closed-form solution.
2. Train a linear regression model on the LeToR dataset using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
